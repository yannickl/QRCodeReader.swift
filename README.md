## QRCodeReaderViewController

The _QRCodeReaderViewController_ is a simple QRCode Reader/Scanner based on the _AVFoundation_ framework from Apple. It aims to replace ZXing or ZBar for iOS 7 and over.

### Installation

The recommended approach to use _QRCodeReaderViewController_ in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add _QRCodeReaderViewController_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'QRCodeReaderViewController', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/QRCodeReaderViewController/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `QRCodeReaderViewController` folder into your project and then simply `#import "QRCodeReaderViewController.h"` in the file(s) you would like to use it in.

## Usage

```objective-c
- (IBAction)scanAction:(id)sender
{
  QRCodeReaderViewController *reader = [QRCodeReaderViewController new];
  reader.modalPresentationStyle      = UIModalPresentationFormSheet;
  reader.delegate                    = self;

  [self presentViewController:reader animated:YES completion:NULL];
}

#pragma mark - QRCodeReader Delegate Methods

- (void)reader:(QRCodeReaderViewController *)reader didScanResult:(NSString *)result
{
  [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
    NSLog(@"%@", result);
  }];
}

- (void)readerDidCancel:(QRCodeReaderViewController *)reader
{
  [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:NULL];
}
```
